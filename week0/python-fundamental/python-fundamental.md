# Python Fundamentals

Recap from Week 6: Python in CS50x

## **Note**

For this week, you will write a few short Python functions. The primary objectives are to ensure that:

- You are familiar with basic Python syntax constructs
- Your programming environment is set up correctly
- You know how to import and use classes that have been pre-written for you

For this course, we assume you are comfortable with:

- Iterating over a list of elements usingfor andwhile loops
- Accessing elements in a list or array using their indices
- Passing functions as parameters to other functions
- Using classes pre-written for you (imported into your code to create objects)
- Writing your own classes (including extending existing classes)
- Writing unit tests for your code
- Debugging your solutions

None of the functions in this assignment, will require Python knowledge beyond what was covered in CS50x Course. If you completed the CS50x classes, you should be able to complete this assignment.
